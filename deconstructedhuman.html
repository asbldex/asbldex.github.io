                        <p>Organoid chips</p><p>An organoid (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaw2459'>1</a>,<a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0325-y'>2</a>) is a small clump of living cells. It survives independently if provided with nutrients and waste clearance. <a href='https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-announces-plan-phase-out-animal-testing-requirement-monoclonal-antibodies-and-other-drugs'>US FDA is replacing animal trials</a> for drugs, starting with monoclonal antibodies, with organoids and organ-on-a-chip systems.</p><p>ASBL machines use organoids. ASBL machines have in-built functions (in ASBL machine protocol) to provide nutrients to and extract waste from organoid microenvironments. An ASBL organoid chip is called a biofloppy, and is used like a floppy disk.</p><p>Biofloppy Usage<br>1. Insert a biofloppy with organoids in the biofloppy drive of an ASBL machine<br>2. ASBL recognizes the biofloppy and displays media requirements<br>3. Insert a 96-well plate with required media into the ASBL machine for organoid maintenance<br>4. Access biofloppy applications with ASBL terminal</p><p>Biofloppy Applications<br>1. Create patient organoids from autologous (derived from patient) cells<br>2. Test personalized therapies on patient organoids in cancer and autoimmune diseases<br>3. Develop organ-targeting and cell-targeting therapies with parallel assays on multiple biofloppies<br>4. Cell therapy research and manufacturing</p><p>Available Biofloppies (<a href='mailto:automatedsyntheticbiologylabs@gmail.com'>order by email</a>)<br>1. Bone marrow biofloppy<br>2. Cardiac muscle biofloppy<br> 3. Liver hepatocyte biofloppy<br>4. Lung biofloppy<br>5. Neuron biofloppy<br>6. Intestinal biofloppy<br>7. Endometrium biofloppy<br>8. Skin epithelium biofloppy<br>9. Empty biofloppy (create and save organoids)</p><p><a href='#'>Deconstructed Human</a> is a package sold commercially by ASBL. It includes one of all available biofloppies, 96-well plates with 90-day media for all biofloppies, and training on organoid manipulation on ASBL machines.</p>
