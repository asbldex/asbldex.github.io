                        <p>Automated Synthetic Biology Labs</p><p>ASBL makes machines for keyboard biotechnology. Ditch the gloves, be a keyboard bioengineer.</p><p>ASBL is a biotechnology company developing drugs and machines for bioengineers. We develop drugs for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes. Our machines are <a href='asbllab0.html'>ASBL Lab 0</a>, <a href='asbl1.html'>ASBL 1</a>, and <a href='asblii.html'>ASBL II</a>. Our vision of biotechnology is to put it in the hands of everyone by way of our machines. ASBL simplifies biotechnology so anyone can do it without an expensive lab or PhD training. ASBL machine protocol is our language of biotechnology. Think of it as Assembly language for biotechnology. ASBL machine protocol is the language on which ASBL machines operate.</p><p>Our drug development effort uses cutting edge biotechnology including <a href='deconstructedhuman.html'>organoid systems</a>, high-throughput assays, and targeted delivery. Our drugs bioengineer by harnessing the human body's innate mechanisms to target inflammation and glucose imbalance.</p><p>We also build and freely release software. Our computational biology pipelines are available for the world to use. Our software includes <a href='humangemlib.html'>humangemlib</a> Python library and <a href='https://matrixdex.github.io'>Protocol Dex</a> biotechnology protocol index.</p><p>ASBL INC. is incorporated in Delaware, United States. ASBL is headquartered in Greater Boston, Massachusetts, United States.</p><p>Cap table<br><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/noorulali'>Noorul Ali</a>&emsp;100%</p><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-matrix-10'>LinkedIn</a></p><p><a href='https://www.instagram.com/matrixdex'>Instagram</a></p>
